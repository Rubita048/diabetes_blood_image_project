# Blood Image Analysis for Diabetes Research (Student Project)

This project explores blood smear images using computer vision and deep learning
to understand morphological patterns that could correlate with diabetes.

## Structure
- `data/`: Datasets (raw and processed)
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks (weekly progress)
- `src/`: Reusable Python scripts
- `results/`: Models, figures, metrics
- `report/`: Final report and presentation

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open notebooks in order (`week1_...`, `week2_...`)
3. Models and outputs are stored in `results/`
